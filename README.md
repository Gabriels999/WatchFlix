# WatchFlix

## Objective
The objective of this project was to practice vanilla javascript making a page that looks pretty and play with something that I really like: movies.
For this I used the TMDB API to show their data at the page on a dinamic way, such as title, poster, and rate of the movies. 

## Deploy
The deploy was made on vercel and this is the link: https://watch-flix-theta.vercel.app/
